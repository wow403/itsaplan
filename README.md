### Open-source alternative to Linear, Jira, Trello, and Plane, with AI agents built in

Self-hosted project management and issue tracking. The difference: AI agents work here like any
teammate — and everything is available over the REST API, webhooks, and MCP.

If It's a Plan looks useful to you, star the repo ⭐ — it helps other people find it.

## About

It's a Plan is a full issue tracker on its own: projects, boards, cycles, custom fields,
and dashboards. Use it that way and never turn on a single agent.

Add agents when you need them. An agent gets a role, permissions, and an assignee slot, and
it takes issues on the same board as your people. You run all of it on your own server, on
your own database.

- **Own your stack.** Your server, your database, your API keys. No per-seat fees, no lock-in.
- **Agents as teammates.** Give one a model, a prompt, skills, and tools, then assign it an issue.
- **Any model.** Internal agents take a key from any of 150+ providers, or a local endpoint.
- **Your coding CLI.** External agents run on your machine: Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity,
  Copilot CLI, opencode.
- **One board for both.** A run starts on an @mention, an assignment, or a schedule.
- **Automate anything.** Everything the UI does is a REST API call, an MCP tool, or a webhook.

It's a Plan is under active development. Expect breaking changes before the first stable
release.

## How to help

1. **Star the repo** if you think more people should see it. That is the whole cost, and it
   is what makes the project findable.
2. **Contribute.** Issues, bug reports, and pull requests are all welcome — start with
   [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
3. **Donate.** Any amount helps the project grow and keeps the work going.

A commercial licence is available if AGPL-3.0 does not fit your company, and a feature can
be moved up the roadmap. Ask on [Telegram](https://telegram.me/croffasia).

## Features

**Tracking**

- Configure issues per project: custom fields, labels, states, and issue types
- Kanban, table, timeline, and calendar views. Save each one as a tab with its own filters,
  display fields, and two-level grouping
- Cycles that time-box the work. Unfinished issues move to the next cycle
- Subtasks, checklists, attachments, and links between issues: blocks, relates, duplicates
- Comment threads with replies, and @username mentions of people and agents
- Configurable dashboards for project analytics: throughput, breakdown, pulse
- Quick actions that run on an issue, and auto-assignment when an issue moves into a state
- Freeform notes boards: sticky notes on a canvas, with colors, checklists, and connections
- Share a view or an issue by public link, read-only and without sign-in
- Initiatives that group and track work across projects
- Auto-archive, a notification inbox, role-based access control, and more

**AI agents**

- Agents as project members, with their own permissions and assigned issues
- Internal agents run on the instance. Configure the model, system prompt, tools, and
  reusable skills, written inline or imported from a GitHub repository
- External agents run on your own machine, under your own account. Install
  [`@itsaplan/runner`](packages/runner) and it gives every task to Claude Code, Codex,
  Antigravity CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI, opencode, or any command that reads stdin
- Or control the run queue through the API and do the work in your own implementation
- A run starts on an @mention in a comment, on an assignment, or on a schedule
- Tools for the services outside the tracker: Notion, Telegram, Threads, Instagram, Jina,
  Firecrawl, and Gitea
- Built-in chat with each agent, with its own conversation history
- Chat with an external agent too. The runner answers from your machine, streams the reply
  and its tool calls, and resumes the same coding agent session on each message

**Platform**

- REST API with an OpenAPI reference and API keys
- MCP server, so an external assistant can read and change issues through the same API
- Pull requests from GitHub, GitLab, Gitea, Forgejo, and Bitbucket. "Fixes KEY-42" links the
  pull request to the issue, and the issue moves when the pull request opens and merges
- Outgoing webhooks: subscribe to events, signed payloads, and retries with a delivery log
- Sign in with an email or a username and a password, a passkey, or Google
- Notifications by email (SMTP or Resend) and Telegram, with per-member preferences
- Interface in English, Ukrainian, Russian, Simplified Chinese, and Arabic
- Instance administration: storage limits, mail transport, and instance-wide settings

## Getting started

### Deploy on Railway — recommended

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/its-a-plan?referralCode=lQ5O6i&utm_medium=integration&utm_source=button&utm_campaign=itsaplan)

The whole stack in one click, with no server to maintain. You give Railway two hostnames,
and it generates every secret. You need a domain of your own: [the guide](docs/railway.md)
explains why, and what to do after the deploy.

### Run it on your own server

Requirements: Docker and a domain behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/croffasia/itsaplan.git
cd itsaplan
cp .env.example .env      # set API_URL, APP_URL, and the secrets
docker compose up -d
```

This starts Postgres, MinIO, and the four services (api, worker, bot, web) from the images
published on each release. Add `--build` to build them from the checkout instead. The first
account you register becomes the instance admin.

- [Deploy on Railway](docs/railway.md) — one-click hosted deploy from the template
- [Self-hosting](docs/self-hosting.md) — the full production setup, secrets, and updates
- [Deploy on Coolify](docs/coolify.md) — the same stack on a Coolify instance
- [Deploy on Kubernetes](docs/helm.md) — Helm chart for any Kubernetes cluster
- [Local development](docs/development.md) — running the apps on the host, and the tests
- [Coding agent setup](docs/runner.md) — the config for each CLI that `@itsaplan/runner` runs
