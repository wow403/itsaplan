// macros reference `user`, which is what makes the `user` type flow there. The
// plugin is named, so its resolve runs once per request (dedup).
//
// A deactivated account is refused here rather than at sign-in: deactivation
// arrives over SCIM while sessions and API keys are already open, and this is the
// one place every planner route and the MCP surface pass through.
